# Docker 知识路线

- [Docker 中文Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/)
- [Docker Compose 文档](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Docker Compose 命令说明](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/)


## File Format

- [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
  
Defines the contents and startup behavior of a single container

- [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

Defines a multi-container application

- [Docker Ignore file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)

This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them to images using ADD or COPY.

- [Docker Cli](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)

The main CLI for Docker, includes all docker commands
  

- [Compose Cli](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/)
